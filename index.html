            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>In March 2019, I graduated from the <strong>Le Wagon Full Stack Coding Bootcamp</strong>.
                Over the nine weeks of the bootcamp, I developed a strong interest in Back End Development, and I have been taking further online classes to improve my front end skills.
                I am looking forward to continuing my personal development as a Back End or Full Stack Developer.</p>

                <h3 id="projects" >Here are a few of the projects that I worked on at the Bootcamp:</h3>
        </div>

        <!-- App From the Dead -->
        <div class="TriviaGame">
            <img src="assets/img/Full_Logo2.png" class="whiteboard-image" alt="zombie hand with mobile phone">

            <h3><a href="http://www.appfromthedead.com/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">App From The Dead! (Give your old projects a new life)</a></h3>

            <p>Got an old app gathering dust in a corner of your hard drive? Post it here, and offer customizations as a service. Or are you an entrepreneur who wants an app but doesn't know where to start? Search among our apps, and see if there's something already built that could suit your needs. Log in with just your email, or with LinkedIn using OAuth2. Secure payment is provided by Stripe.</p>
            <p>This was the final group project for the Bootcamp. Technology used: HTML, CSS, Ruby-On-Rails, JavaScript, and JQuery.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Cowork Rental -->
        <div class="Cowork Rental">
            <img src="assets/img/gades-photography-761358-unspl.png" class="movie-image" alt="an empty white desk with a white lamp, a potted plant, and a wooden wall clock">

            <h3><a href="https://cowork-rental.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary ">Cowork Rental (Airbnb for your coworking space)</a></h3>

            <p>This was the first group project that I worked on during the Bootcamp. You can sublet a co-working space, or post your co-working space. It uses the Mapbox API to dynamically display locations close to you on the map.
            </p>
            <p>Technology used: HTML, CSS, Ruby-On-Rails, JavaScript, and JQuery.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Mister Cocktail -->
        <div class="Whiteboard">
            <img src="assets/img/adam-jaime-119551-unsplash-cop.png" class="violin-image" alt="Whiteboard">

            <h3><a href="https://zeebear-mister-cocktail.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">Mister Cocktail</a></h3>

            <p>This was the first Rails app that I pushed to Heroku. It uses an API from <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/" target="_blank">TheCocktailDB</a> to import a list of ingredients that you can use when creating your cocktail recipes, and image hosting through Cloudinary to store your cocktail photo.
